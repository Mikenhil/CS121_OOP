# CS121_OOP

## Assignment Specifications

This is a re-write of the previous Horse Race project. The goal was to write a game in c++
where x number of horses would race to the end of their track by flipping a coin(0 or 1)
to advance in movement. This rewrite implements object oriented programming practices separating
different functions and variables into classes.

**New Additions:** This project requires the use of a UML diagram and a makefile. Psuedocode is in
algorithm.txt

**Requirements:**
- There should be two main classes (Horse, Race)
- The race will contain an array of horses
- Most actions will happen in the horse class.
